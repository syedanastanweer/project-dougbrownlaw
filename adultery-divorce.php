                <h4 data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-duration="800">You just found out your spouse has cheated on you and your marriage is over.</h4>
                <p data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-duration="800">If you have just found out your marriage is over because of infidelity, you are probably feeling
                    disoriented. Feeling that way is natural. When you find out that someone you have been living
                    with--your lover, your best friend, your companion--and possibly even your home and livelihood are
                    all gone, it turns your world upside down and it sometimes makes it hard to just think.</p>
                <p data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-duration="800">A strategy for getting through those difficult first few days is to simply focus on the tasks that
                    are immediately ahead of you. Make a list of what you have to accomplish today, and focus on that
                    each day for the first few days, whether it be a place to live, means to survive, or paying the
                    bills, putting it in writing will make it feel less daunting.</p>
                <p data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-duration="800">One thing that is very important at this stage is that you have good legal advice. Your spouse may
                    have talked to you about what your rights are, or maybe even about what your spouse's
                    responsibilities are to you and the children, but your spouse may not be giving you good advice in
                    that regard. Know what your rights are instead of having to guess what they are, again, is very
                    important at this stage if for no other reason than to give you the confidence to get through the
                    things you are going to have to deal with over the next few weeks and months. I am a Hammond
                    adultery divorce attorney, and I am here to protect you, your children and your property.</p>

                <h4 data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-duration="800">The Divorce Process in Cases of Adultery</h4>
                <p data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-duration="800">You may not know where to start, and that is understandable. Clients contact me with questions
                    regarding their financial future, their living arrangement, child custody, and property and debt
                    division issues. I provide guidance through these issues, and I know there is not a
                    "one-size-fits-all" approach.</p>
                <p data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-duration="800">Remember that Louisiana is a "no-fault" divorce state, meaning proving adultery is not necessary in
                    order to get a divorce. I will help you review and understand your rights, as well as the
                    responsibilities of a cheating spouse. If you have children, the divorce process will take longer -
                    a little over a year, but the time for divorce finalization is reduced if no children are involved.
