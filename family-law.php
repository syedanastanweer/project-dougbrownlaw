                <p>If you have just learned that your marriage is over, its likely your biggest challenge is simply
                    trying to think straight. Very few people truly understand the paralyzing mixture of fear, anger,
                    betrayal, hopelessness, and confusion that the ending of a marriage can create. Your life partner,
                    friend, and confidante is gone and may very likely be an adversary to you. Your entire world has
                    changed, and you don't know where to start.</p>
                <p>In the midst of the mental and emotional challenges, and just trying to get through life, decisions
                    have to be made, and under the worst possible conditions.</p>
                <p>In order to make good decisions, for you and for your family, you need good information, you need to
                    know your rights, and you need a plan. If there is a legal fight and your spouse or former spouse is
                    trying to take advantage of the situation, I know how to deal with that, too.</p>
                <p>I work with men, women and families before, during and after the divorce process, from the initial
                    filing through post-judgment requests for modification or enforcement. I handle all matters related
                    to divorce, including child custody and visitation, child support, alimony or spousal support,
                    property division and paternity actions.</p>
                <p>I also work extensively with clients involved in Office of Community (OCS) cases, where
                    there are concerns about child abuse or neglect. I handle Families in Need of (FINS)
                    proceedings as well as cases involving attempts to terminate parental rights.</p>
                <p>As your attorney, I will defend you, your family, your rights and your reputation aggressively.</p>
