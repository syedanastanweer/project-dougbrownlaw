								I love what I do for a living!
							</p>

							<p>I am entering my third decade of the solo practice of law, and I can’t think of anything
								else I would rather do.</p>
							<p>Every day, I get to make a living helping other people. Part of what I do is answering
								questions for people who have never been through the legal process.</p>
							<p>But I love what I get to do for my clients. I help injured people navigate the complex
								and tricky world of insurance claims.</p>
							<p>I advise and defend people accused of crimes of all sorts, many of whom have never been
								in the system.</p>
							<p>I get to assist divorcing parents through some of the toughest times of their lives. In
								other words, I get to make a difference, and I love it.</p>
							<p>In this blog, I hope to share some of my thoughts about the legal world, and to share
								some of the information I give when people call me with their questions.</p>
							<p>I hope you will find something that you agree with, something that provokes thought, and,
								maybe, something that surprises you. My name is Douglas Brown, and I’m glad you’re here.
							</p>
